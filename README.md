Installation of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security

## Overview
This repository contains Kubernetes manifests for installing Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) on OpenShift clusters.

## Prerequisites
- Access to an OpenShift cluster
- `oc` CLI tool installed
- Cluster admin permissions
- Access to the `redhat-operators` catalog source

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install the ACS Operator
First, install the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security operator on your central cluster:

```bash
oc apply -k k8/operators/
```

Alternatively, you can apply the file directly:

```bash
oc apply -f k8/operators/acs.yaml
```

This will:
- Create the `rhacs-operator` namespace
- Create an OperatorGroup for the namespace
- Subscribe to the `rhacs-operator` from the Red Hat operators catalog

### Step 2: Wait for Operator Installation
Wait for the operator to be fully installed and ready. You can check the status with:

```bash
oc get pods -n rhacs-operator
```

Wait until the operator pod is in `Running` state and ready (typically takes 1-2 minutes).

### Step 3: Create Central Resources
Once the operator is ready, create the Central component:

```bash
oc apply -k k8/central/
```

Alternatively, you can apply the files individually:

```bash
oc apply -f k8/central/namespace.yaml
oc apply -f k8/central/central.yaml
```

This will:
- Create the `stackrox` namespace
- Create a Central custom resource instance
- Trigger the operator to deploy the Central component

### Step 4: Verify Installation
Monitor the Central deployment:

```bash
oc get pods -n stackrox
```
```bash
watch oc get pvc,deploy,svc,route
```

`scanner-db` will take the longest to initialize (~5+ minutes)

The Central component will take several minutes to fully deploy. Once all pods are running, you can access the Central UI through the route that was created.

To check the status of the Central instance via the CLI

```bash
oc get central stackrox-central-services -o jsonpath-as-json='{.status.conditions}'
```

Output:
```json
[
    [
        {
            "lastTransitionTime": "2025-11-21T18:20:34Z",
            "message": "StackRox Central Services has been installed.\n\n\n\n\nStackRox Kubernetes Security Platform collects and transmits anonymous usage and\nsystem configuration information. If you want to OPT OUT from this, use\n--set central.telemetry.enabled=false.\n\n\nThank you for using StackRox!\n",
            "reason": "InstallSuccessful",
            "status": "True",
            "type": "Deployed"
        },
...
```

### Step 4: Log in to the RHACS portal as the admin user

Retrieve the admin user's password from the central-htpasswd secret

```bash
oc extract secret/central-htpasswd \
  --keys password --to -
```

Example output:
```bash
# password
UIooqQXXrcxX0mzDuYUPCo6uX
```
Retrieve the URL of the RHACS portal from the central route

```bash
oc get route central -n stackrox -o jsonpath='https://{.spec.host}'
```

Example Output:
```
https://central-stackrox.apps.cluster-8cj8w.8cj8w.sandbox3260.opentlc.com
```

log in with `admin` and the extracted password

***Note*** If you see the error `The database is currently not available. If this problem persists, please contact support.`
You might not have enough cluster resources to launch the `central-db` deployment. If testing you may be able to scale down the following resources, otherwise provision mode nodes

```bash
oc patch hpa scanner -n stackrox \
  --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"minReplicas":1,"maxReplicas":1}}'

oc patch hpa scanner-v4-indexer -n stackrox \
  --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"minReplicas":1,"maxReplicas":1}}'

oc patch hpa scanner-v4-matcher -n stackrox \
  --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"minReplicas":1,"maxReplicas":1}}'

# Classic scanner: 2 → 1
oc scale deploy scanner --replicas=1

# v4 indexer: 2 → 1
oc scale deploy scanner-v4-indexer --replicas=1

# v4 matcher: 2 → 1
oc scale deploy scanner-v4-matcher --replicas=1

# Optional: if still tight, you can even scale scanner dbs a bit
# but usually just replica cuts are enough.
```

## Configuration Steps

At this point we have a Central cluster, but no secured clusters being managed. Let's start by importing the central cluster first, then import a second cluster.

From the ACS console, under `Platform Configuration`->`Clusters`, click the `Init bundles` button.  
  
From the Cluster init bundles page, click `Create bundle`.  
   
Provide a name (ex. `install-import`), select `OpenShift` and click `Download`

This will download a file to your local system called `install-import-Operator-secrets-cluster-init-bundle.yaml`

Do not close the window.

From the command line:

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/install-import-Operator-secrets-cluster-init-bundle.yaml .

oc apply -f install-import-Operator-secrets-cluster-init-bundle.yaml 
```

While logged into the central cluster, apply the following to have it added as a secured cluster.

Example output
```
secret/collector-tls created
secret/sensor-tls created
secret/admission-control-tls created
```

Create add the cluster to central (this can be done with the operator)
```bash
oc apply -k k8/secured-cluster  
```

Eventually, the cluster will show up in ACS as `Healthy` and `Up to date with Central`
